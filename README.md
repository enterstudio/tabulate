# tabulate
Tabulate is a command-line tool to convert record type data (e.g. CSV files)
into a pretty printed table.

There have been multiple versions of this code over time. The original version
was `tabulate.sh`, which was written because I needed such a tool. Next came
`tabulate.py` as a Python starter project. The most recent version is
`tabulate.go`, which is a Go starter project.

Although all three versions are provided, the only version currently being
improved is the Go version. If you find this project interesting, and would
like to contribute to one or another version, feel free to do so.
